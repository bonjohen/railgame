# Game Assets

This directory contains all game assets, including:

- Images (sprites, backgrounds, UI elements)
- Audio files (music, sound effects)
- Fonts
- Other media files

## Asset Organization

Assets should be organized into subdirectories by type:

- `images/` - For all image files
- `audio/` - For all audio files
- `fonts/` - For custom fonts

## Asset Requirements

- All images should be optimized for web (PNG or WebP format recommended)
- Audio files should be in formats supported by browsers (MP3, OGG)
- Asset filenames should be descriptive and use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `road-background.png`)
