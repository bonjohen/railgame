To effectively address the game development requirements, we can organize the tasks into four largely independent categories.  

1. Core Gameplay Mechanics

Objective:  

Relevant Requirements:

3.1: Develop the main game scene as the primary interface for gameplay.

3.2: Integrate a road background image to establish the game setting.

3.4: Incorporate a character sprite representing the player's controllable entity.

4.1: Enable character movement left and right along the road using touch input.

4.2: Ensure the character's movement is confined within the road boundaries to prevent off-screen navigation.

4.3: Create an illusion of continuous forward motion down the road for the character.



2. User Interface and Controls

Objective:  

Relevant Requirements:

5.1: Add a vertical ellipsis (â‹®) button in the upper-right corner for accessing the game menu.

5.1.1: Configure the button to pause the game and display a "Menu" with "Resume" and "Exit" options.

5.1.1.1: Selecting "Resume" should close the menu and resume gameplay.

5.1.1.2: Selecting "Exit" should prompt a confirmation dialog with "Yes" and "Cancel" options.

5.1.1.2.1: Choosing "Yes" exits the game.

5.1.1.2.2: Choosing "Cancel" returns to the game menu without resuming gameplay.




7.1: Ensure the user interface provides clear instructions and feedback.

7.2: Design the menu options to be clearly visible and distinguishable from other game elements.

7.3: Ensure the user interface is responsive and adapts to various screen sizes and orientations.



3. Asset Management and Performance Optimization

Objective:  

Relevant Requirements:

3.3: Implement a loading screen to inform players during asset loading.

6.1: Preload all game assets, including images and sounds, before the game starts.

6.2: Optimize assets to minimize load times and enhance performance.

6.3: Develop an asset management system for efficient loading and organization.

8.1: Maintain a consistent frame rate for smooth animations and responsive controls.

8.2: Manage memory usage effectively to prevent leaks and ensure efficiency across devices.

8.3: Utilize techniques like object pooling and lazy loading to optimize performance.



4. Compatibility and Testing

Objective:  

Relevant Requirements:

9.1: Verify the game operates correctly within the Android Emulator provided by Android Studio.

9.2: Ensure the game is responsive and playable on various Android device screen sizes.

9.3: Conduct testing on multiple devices to confirm compatibility and performance.
