# Rail Game Development Workflow

## Introduction

To effectively address the game development requirements, we have organized the tasks into four sequential categories. Each category represents a key phase in the development process, with some testing integrated into each section (approximately 20% coverage).

Each requirement is marked with a status indicator:
- [ ] Not Started
- [ðŸ”„] In Progress
- [âœ“] Completed

## 1. Project Setup and Asset Management

**Objective:** Establish the project structure, set up the development environment, and implement the asset management system. Create a loading screen and prepare all necessary game assets for efficient use in the application.

**Status:** [âœ“]

**Relevant Requirements:**

- [âœ“] 1.1: Create a structured directory layout to effectively organize source code, assets, and configuration files.

- [âœ“] 1.2: Store all game assets in a designated assets directory within the project.

- [âœ“] 1.3: Adhere to best practices for Phaser and Webpack integration in the project structure.

- [âœ“] 3.3: Implement a loading screen to inform players during asset loading.

- [âœ“] 6.1: Preload all game assets, including images and sounds, before the game starts.

- [âœ“] 6.2: Optimize assets to minimize load times and enhance performance.

- [âœ“] 6.3: Develop a simple asset management system for efficient loading and organization.

## 2. Core Gameplay Mechanics

**Objective:** Create a basic gameplay experience with a character that appears to move continuously down a road. Implement touch controls for left and right movement within defined boundaries.

**Status:** [ ]

**Relevant Requirements:**

- [ ] 3.1: Develop the main game scene as the primary interface for gameplay.

- [ ] 3.2: Integrate a road background image to establish the game setting.

- [ ] 3.4: Incorporate a character sprite representing the player's controllable entity.

- [ ] 4.1: Enable character movement left and right along the road using touch input.

- [ ] 4.2: Ensure the character's movement is confined within the road boundaries to prevent off-screen navigation.

- [ ] 4.3: Create an illusion of continuous forward motion down the road (using scrolling background or simple visual elements that grow in size as they move down).

## 3. User Interface and Controls

**Objective:** Develop a minimal but functional user interface with menu options for pause and exit functionality. Ensure the UI is responsive to different screen sizes.

**Status:** [ ]

**Relevant Requirements:**

- [ ] 5.1: Add a vertical ellipsis (â‹®) button in the upper-right corner for accessing the game menu.

- [ ] 5.1.1: Configure the button to pause the game and display a "Menu" with "Resume" and "Exit" options.

- [ ] 5.1.1.1: Selecting "Resume" should close the menu and resume gameplay.

- [ ] 5.1.1.2: Selecting "Exit" should prompt a confirmation dialog with "Yes" and "Cancel" options.

- [ ] 7.1: Ensure the user interface provides clear feedback.

- [ ] 7.3: Ensure the user interface adapts to various screen sizes and orientations.

## 4. Performance Optimization and Compatibility

**Objective:** Optimize the game for performance and ensure it functions correctly on Android devices. Conduct basic testing to verify functionality and responsiveness.

**Status:** [ ]

**Relevant Requirements:**

- [ ] 8.1: Maintain a consistent frame rate for smooth animations and responsive controls.

- [ ] 8.2: Manage memory usage effectively for efficiency across devices.

- [ ] 9.1: Verify the game operates correctly within the Android Emulator provided by Android Studio.

- [ ] 9.2: Ensure the game is responsive and playable on various Android device screen sizes.
