# Behind-View Perspective Transformation Plan

This document outlines the plan to transform our 2D rail game into a behind-view perspective game, creating a more immersive 3D-like experience while maintaining the core gameplay mechanics.

## Summary of Work

The transformation will focus on three main areas:

### 1. Visual Perspective Changes

- Replace the 2D top-down road with a 3D perspective road that narrows toward a vanishing point
- Create a horizon line with sky at the top of the screen
- Add side elements (trees, buildings, terrain) that scale based on distance
- Reposition the character to the lower third of the screen, showing its back
- Implement proper scaling of all game elements based on their virtual distance

### 2. Movement Mechanics

- Maintain left/right movement but adapt it to the perspective view
- Implement lane-based movement system for more structured gameplay
- Add banking/turning animations when moving laterally
- Create perspective-correct scrolling with converging road lines
- Implement scaling of side elements as they approach the player
- Add parallax scrolling for background elements to enhance depth

### 3. Gameplay Adjustments

- Scale obstacles dynamically as they approach from the distance
- Spawn obstacles at the horizon and have them grow larger as they approach
- Position obstacles in specific lanes for more strategic gameplay
- Modify projectiles to fire toward the vanishing point
- Implement perspective scaling for projectiles as they travel into the distance
- Adjust collision detection to account for the perspective view

## Implementation Approach: Pseudo-3D with 2D Engine

We'll use a technique known as "pseudo-3D" or "2.5D" that creates the illusion of 3D using our existing 2D Phaser engine. This approach:

- Uses scaling, positioning, and perspective techniques to simulate 3D depth
- Implements a projection system to convert positions from a virtual 3D space to 2D screen coordinates
- Scales sprites based on their virtual distance from the viewer
- Maintains compatibility with our current Phaser setup
- Requires less computational resources than a full 3D implementation

### Key Technical Components

```javascript
// Perspective projection function
function projectToScreen(x, z, roadWidth) {
  const cameraHeight = 1000;
  const cameraDepth = 0.84;

  // Scale based on distance (z)
  const scale = cameraDepth / z;

  // Project x position with perspective
  const projectedX = (this.gameWidth / 2) + (scale * x * this.gameWidth / 2);

  // Project y position with perspective
  const projectedY = (this.gameHeight / 2) - (scale * cameraHeight * this.gameWidth / 2);

  return {
    x: projectedX,
    y: projectedY,
    scale: scale
  };
}

// Create perspective road segments
function createPerspectiveRoad() {
  // Create road segments that get narrower toward the horizon
  const segments = [];
  const segmentCount = 20;

  for (let i = 0; i < segmentCount; i++) {
    const y = this.gameHeight - (i * (this.gameHeight / segmentCount));
    const width = this.gameWidth * (1 - (i / segmentCount) * 0.7);

    const segment = this.add.rectangle(
      this.gameWidth / 2,
      y,
      width,
      this.gameHeight / segmentCount,
      i % 2 === 0 ? 0x333333 : 0x444444
    );

    segments.push(segment);
  }

  return segments;
}

// Scale objects based on distance
function scaleByDistance(sprite, distance) {
  // Scale objects based on their distance from the viewer
  // distance: 0 (closest) to 1 (horizon)
  const scale = 1 - (distance * 0.8);
  sprite.setScale(scale);

  // Also adjust y position based on perspective
  const y = this.gameHeight - (this.gameHeight * distance * 0.7);
  sprite.y = y;

  return sprite;
}

// Position objects in specific lanes
function positionInLane(sprite, lane, distance) {
  // Position an object in a specific lane at a specific distance
  // lane: 0 (leftmost) to laneCount-1 (rightmost)
  // distance: 0 (closest) to 1 (horizon)

  const laneCount = 3; // Example: 3 lanes
  const laneWidth = this.gameWidth * 0.6; // Road width

  // Calculate lane center positions
  const laneSize = laneWidth / laneCount;
  const roadLeftEdge = (this.gameWidth - laneWidth) / 2;
  const laneCenter = roadLeftEdge + (lane * laneSize) + (laneSize / 2);

  // Adjust for perspective (lanes converge at horizon)
  const perspectiveX = this.gameWidth / 2 + (laneCenter - this.gameWidth / 2) * (1 - distance * 0.8);

  sprite.x = perspectiveX;

  // Also scale and position vertically
  return this.scaleByDistance(sprite, distance);
}
```
