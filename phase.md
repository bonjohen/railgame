To enhance the 'railgame' project, we'll expand upon the initial requirements by detailing the necessary steps for implementation. These steps will then be organized into three independent and logically separated phases of work. This structured approach ensures a systematic development process, allowing for focused progress and easier debugging.

**Phase 1: Core Character Controls and Interaction** [✓]

1. **Implement Touch Controls for Character Movement:** [✓]
   - Detect touch inputs on the screen's bottom quarter to ensure character control is confined to this area. [✓]
   - Recognize 'click-hold' gestures to the left or right of the character's current position, moving the character accordingly. [✓]
   - Prioritize 'drag' gestures over 'click-hold' gestures, moving the character in the drag's direction. [✓]

2. **Restrict Control Area:** [✓]
   - Define the bottom quarter of the screen as the interactive zone for character movement, ignoring inputs outside this area. [✓]

**Phase 2: User Interface Enhancements**

1. **Adjust Game Display for Samsung S23 Ultra:**
   - Optimize the game's resolution and aspect ratio to fit the Samsung S23 Ultra's screen dimensions, ensuring a full-screen experience without distortion.
   - Test and adjust touch sensitivity and responsiveness to align with the device's capabilities.

2. **Design and Implement a Top Bar:**
   - Create a top bar displaying health, score, and progress to completion, ensuring it remains unobtrusive yet accessible.
   - Integrate a vertical ellipsis (three-dot menu) within the top bar for additional options or settings.

**Phase 3: Game Mechanics and Feedback**

1. **Correct Yellow Line Movement:**
   - Analyze the current behavior of the yellow line to identify the cause of its incorrect movement.
   - Implement the necessary adjustments to ensure the yellow line moves as intended, enhancing gameplay consistency.

2. **Implement Collision Detection and Response:**
   - Develop a system to detect collisions between the character and in-game objects.
   - Upon collision, trigger an appropriate animation to provide visual feedback.
   - Remove or deactivate the colliding object from the game environment.
   - Reduce the character's health accordingly and update the health display on the top bar.

By organizing the development process into these three phases, we can systematically address each aspect of the game, ensuring a smooth and efficient development cycle.
