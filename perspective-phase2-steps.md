# Phase 2 Implementation Steps: Character and Movement Adaptation

## Reposition and Redesign Character

- [✓] Create a back-view sprite for the character
- [✓] Position character in the lower third of the screen
- [✓] Implement proper scaling and perspective for the character
- [✓] Add character shadow for better grounding

## Implement Lane-Based Movement

- [✓] Create a defined number of lanes (3)
- [✓] Adapt left/right controls to move between lanes
- [✓] Add smooth lane transition animations
- [✓] Implement banking/turning animations during lane changes
- [✓] Add visual feedback for lane changes (motion blur)

## Enhance Movement Visuals

- [✓] Add speed lines for motion effect
- [✓] Implement camera shake for rough terrain
- [✓] Create visual feedback for movement (floating animation)

## Testing

- [✓] Create a test script to verify the implementation
- [✓] Test the game in the browser to confirm functionality
- [✓] Verify all Phase 2 requirements are met

## Commit and Sync

- [✓] Update the phase.md file to mark completed items
- [✓] Commit the changes to the repository
- [✓] Push the changes to GitHub

## Next Steps

The next phase to implement is Phase 3: Obstacles and Projectiles in Perspective, which includes:

1. Adapting the obstacle system for the perspective view
2. Transforming the projectile system
3. Revamping the collision system
