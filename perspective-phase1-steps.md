# Phase 1 Implementation Steps: Basic Perspective Road and Environment

## Create Perspective Road System

- [✓] Create PerspectiveScene class
- [✓] Implement road segments that narrow toward the horizon
- [✓] Add road markings that converge at the vanishing point
- [✓] Create a horizon line with sky gradient background
- [✓] Implement basic depth scaling for the road elements

## Establish Virtual 3D Coordinate System

- [✓] Create a projection system to convert 3D coordinates to 2D screen positions
- [✓] Implement distance-based scaling functions
- [✓] Set up a virtual camera position and field of view

## Add Basic Environment Elements

- [✓] Create simple side elements (trees) with proper scaling
- [✓] Implement a basic sky background
- [✓] Add ground textures that scale with distance

## Testing

- [✓] Create a test script to verify the implementation
- [✓] Test the game in the browser to confirm functionality
- [✓] Verify all Phase 1 requirements are met

## Commit and Sync

- [✓] Commit the changes to the repository
- [✓] Push the changes to GitHub

## Next Steps

The next phase to implement is Phase 2: Character and Movement Adaptation, which includes:

1. Repositioning and redesigning the character
2. Implementing lane-based movement
3. Enhancing movement visuals
