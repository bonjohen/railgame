# Phase 3 Implementation Steps: Obstacles and Projectiles in Perspective

## Adapt Obstacle System

- [✓] Redesign obstacles to work in the perspective view
- [✓] Spawn obstacles at the horizon in specific lanes
- [✓] Implement dynamic scaling as obstacles approach the player
- [✓] Create distance-based movement speed adjustments

## Transform Projectile System

- [✓] Modify projectiles to fire toward the vanishing point
- [✓] Implement perspective scaling for projectiles
- [✓] Adjust projectile speed based on virtual distance
- [✓] Create perspective-correct particle effects

## Revamp Collision System

- [✓] Implement lane-based collision detection
- [✓] Create distance-aware hitboxes
- [✓] Add visual feedback for near misses
- [✓] Implement collision animations that respect perspective

## Testing

- [✓] Create a test script to verify the implementation
- [✓] Test the game in the browser to confirm functionality
- [✓] Verify all Phase 3 requirements are met

## Commit and Sync

- [✓] Update the phase.md file to mark completed items
- [ ] Commit the changes to the repository
- [ ] Push the changes to GitHub

## Next Steps

The next phase to implement is Phase 4: Visual Enhancements and Polish, which includes:

1. Adding rich environment details
2. Implementing advanced visual effects
3. Polishing the user interface
