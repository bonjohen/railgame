# Rail Game Implementation Steps

## Introduction

This document outlines the detailed implementation steps to complete each of the four sequential categories in the workflow document. Each step is associated with a specific requirement number from the requirements document and includes a completion status indicator. The focus is on creating a minimum viable application with basic functionality.

Each step is marked with a status indicator:
- [ ] Not Started
- [ðŸ”„] In Progress
- [âœ“] Completed

### Asset Management (Requirements 6.1, 6.2, 6.3)

- [âœ“] 6.1.1: Create or acquire minimal game assets (road background, character sprite, menu button)
- [âœ“] 6.1.2: Implement asset preloading in the LoadingScene
- [âœ“] 6.2.1: Optimize image assets for web use (appropriate size and format)
- [âœ“] 6.3.1: Create a simple system to organize and access game assets

### Testing (20% Coverage)

- [âœ“] T1.1: Verify the project structure is correctly set up
- [âœ“] T1.2: Test the loading screen functionality
- [âœ“] T1.3: Confirm all assets load correctly

## Section 2: Core Gameplay Mechanics

**Objective:** Create a basic gameplay experience with a character that appears to move continuously down a road using simple visual techniques.

**Status:** [âœ“]

### Main Scene Setup (Requirement 3.1)

- [âœ“] 3.1.1: Define a new class named `MainScene` that extends `Phaser.Scene`
- [âœ“] 3.1.2: Implement the `constructor`, `preload`, `create`, and `update` methods
- [âœ“] 3.1.3: Configure the scene to receive assets from the LoadingScene

### Road Background Implementation (Requirement 3.2)

- [âœ“] 3.2.1: Add the road background as a tile sprite in the MainScene
- [âœ“] 3.2.2: Implement scrolling of the road background in the update method

### Character Sprite Implementation (Requirement 3.4)

- [âœ“] 3.4.1: Add the character sprite to the scene
- [âœ“] 3.4.2: Position the character at the bottom center of the screen

### Character Movement Controls (Requirements 4.1, 4.2)

- [âœ“] 4.1.1: Implement left/right movement based on touch input
- [âœ“] 4.2.1: Add boundary constraints to keep the character on the road

### Forward Motion Illusion (Requirement 4.3)

- [âœ“] 4.3.1: Create a simple visual element (like a line or dot) that moves from top to bottom
- [âœ“] 4.3.2: Make the element grow in size as it moves down to create depth perception
- [âœ“] 4.3.3: Reset the element to the top when it reaches the bottom

### Testing (20% Coverage)

- [âœ“] T2.1: Test character movement controls
- [âœ“] T2.2: Verify the road scrolling effect works correctly
- [âœ“] T2.3: Confirm the illusion of forward motion is convincing

## Section 3: User Interface and Controls

**Objective:** Implement a minimal but functional menu system with pause and exit functionality.

**Status:** [âœ“]

### Menu Button Implementation (Requirement 5.1)

- [âœ“] 5.1.1: Add a vertical ellipsis (â‹®) button in the upper-right corner
- [âœ“] 5.1.2: Make the button interactive

### Menu Functionality (Requirements 5.1.1, 5.1.1.1, 5.1.1.2)

- [âœ“] 5.1.1.1: Create a simple menu with "Resume" and "Exit" options
- [âœ“] 5.1.1.2: Implement pause functionality when the menu is opened
- [âœ“] 5.1.1.3: Implement resume functionality for the "Resume" option
- [âœ“] 5.1.1.4: Add a confirmation dialog for the "Exit" option

### UI Responsiveness (Requirements 7.1, 7.3)

- [âœ“] 7.1.1: Add visual feedback for button interactions
- [âœ“] 7.3.1: Implement basic responsive scaling for UI elements

### Testing (20% Coverage)
