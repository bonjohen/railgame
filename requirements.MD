# Basic Game Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the fundamental requirements for developing a simple 2D game using Phaser with Webpack. The game, tentatively titled "Rail Game," is a casual mobile game designed primarily for Android devices.

## Game Overview

In Rail Game, the player controls a character moving continuously down a road. The character can be maneuvered left and right using touch controls. The game creates an illusion of forward motion using visual techniques such as a scrolling background and/or elements that grow in size as they move down the screen.

A menu system, accessible via a vertical ellipsis button (â‹®) in the upper-right corner, allows the player to pause, resume, or exit the game. The user interface is designed to be intuitive and responsive across various Android device screen sizes.

## Development Approach

This project follows a minimum viable product (MVP) approach, focusing on implementing only the essential features needed to demonstrate the core concept. Each development phase includes approximately 20% test coverage to ensure basic functionality while minimizing development time.

## Purpose

This requirements document serves as the definitive reference for all development work on the Rail Game project. It provides detailed specifications for project structure, development environment, gameplay mechanics, user interface, performance optimization, and compatibility requirements.

â”œâ”€â”€ README.md            # Project overview and instructions
â””â”€â”€ webpack.config.js    # Webpack configuration
```

This structure promotes modularity and maintainability, aligning with standard practices for Phaser and Webpack projects.

## 2. Development Environment Setup

- **Requirement 2.1:** The following applications must be installed to set up the development environment:
  - **Status:** [âœ“]

  - **Android Studio (2022.1.1):** To provide the Android Emulator for testing the application.
    - **Status:** [ðŸ”„]

  - **Visual Studio Code (1.78.2):** As the code editor for development.
    - **Status:** [âœ“]

  - **Git (2.40.1):** For source control management.
    - **Status:** [âœ“]

- **Requirement 2.2:** The project must utilize the following libraries with specified versions:
  - **Status:** [âœ“]

  - **Phaser (v3.60.0):** The game framework for developing the game.
    - **Status:** [âœ“]

  - **Webpack (v5.75.0):** To bundle JavaScript files and handle asset loading.
    - **Status:** [âœ“]

  - **Babel (v7.21.0):** To transpile modern JavaScript for compatibility.
    - **Status:** [âœ“]

- **Requirement 2.3:** The Android Emulator provided by Android Studio must be used to test and demonstrate the application.

- **Requirement 2.4:** GitHub will be used to manage source control. The repository will be hosted at `github.com/bonhohen/railgame`.
  - **Status:** [âœ“]

- **Requirement 2.5:** A consistent library versioning approach must be employed to ensure compatibility and stability. In JavaScript projects, this is typically managed using `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files:
  - **Status:** [âœ“]

  - **`package.json`:** Specifies the project dependencies with version ranges.
    - **Status:** [âœ“]

  - **`package-lock.json`:** Locks the exact versions of dependencies to ensure consistency across installations.
    - **Status:** [âœ“]

This approach is analogous to Python's virtual environments and `requirements.txt` for dependency management.

## 3. Game Scene
