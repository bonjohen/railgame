# Basic Game Requirements Document

This document outlines the fundamental requirements for developing a simple 2D game using Phaser with Webpack. In this game, the player controls a character moving continuously down a road. The character can be maneuvered left and right using touch controls while avoiding obstacles. A menu, accessible via a vertical ellipsis button in the upper-right corner, allows the player to pause, resume, or exit the game. The primary deployment target is Android devices.

## 1. Project Structure

- **Requirement 1.1:** The project must have a structured directory layout to effectively organize source code, assets, and configuration files.

- **Requirement 1.2:** All game assets, including images and sounds, must be stored in a designated assets directory within the project.

- **Requirement 1.3:** The project structure should adhere to best practices for Phaser and Webpack integration, including the following directories and files:

project-root/ ├── dist/                # Distribution folder for production builds ├── node_modules/        # Node.js modules ├── src/                 # Source code │   ├── assets/          # Game assets (images, sounds) │   ├── scenes/          # Game scenes │   ├── index.js         # Main JavaScript file │   └── ...              # Additional source files ├── .babelrc             # Babel configuration ├── .gitignore           # Git ignore file ├── package.json         # Node.js project metadata ├── README.md            # Project overview and instructions └── webpack.config.js    # Webpack configuration

This structure promotes modularity and maintainability, aligning with standard practices for Phaser and Webpack projects.

## 2. Development Environment Setup

- **Requirement 2.1:** The following applications must be installed to set up the development environment:

- **Node.js (v18.16.0):** To manage project dependencies and run development scripts.

- **Android Studio (2022.1.1):** To provide the Android Emulator for testing the application.

- **Visual Studio Code (1.78.2):** As the code editor for development.

- **Git (2.40.1):** For source control management.

- **Requirement 2.2:** The project must utilize the following libraries with specified versions:

- **Phaser (v3.60.0):** The game framework for developing the game.

- **Webpack (v5.75.0):** To bundle JavaScript files and handle asset loading.

- **Babel (v7.21.0):** To transpile modern JavaScript for compatibility.

- **Requirement 2.3:** The Android Emulator provided by Android Studio must be used to test and demonstrate the application.

- **Requirement 2.4:** GitHub will be used to manage source control. The repository will be hosted at `github.com/bonhohen/railgame`.

- **Requirement 2.5:** A consistent library versioning approach must be employed to ensure compatibility and stability. In JavaScript projects, this is typically managed using `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files:

- **`package.json`:** Specifies the project dependencies with version ranges.

- **`package-lock.json`:** Locks the exact versions of dependencies to ensure consistency across installations.

This approach is analogous to Python's virtual environments and `requirements.txt` for dependency management.

## 3. Game Scene

- **Requirement 3.1:** The game must include a main scene that serves as the primary interface for gameplay.

- **Requirement 3.2:** The main scene must display a road background image to set the environment for the game.

- **Requirement 3.3:** A loading screen must be implemented to inform the player that assets are being loaded.

- **Requirement 3.4:** A character sprite must be present on the road, representing the player's controllable entity.

## 4. Character Movement

- **Requirement 4.1:** The character must be able to move left and right along the horizontal axis of the road using touch input.

- **Requirement 4.2:** The character's movement must be constrained within the boundaries of the road to prevent it from moving off-screen.

- **Requirement 4.3:** The character must appear to be moving continuously down the road, creating an illusion of forward motion.

## 5. Game Menu

- **Requirement 5.1:** A vertical ellipsis (⋮) button must be displayed in the upper-right corner of the game screen, allowing access to the game menu.

- **Requirement 5.1.1:** Tapping the vertical ellipsis button must pause the game and display a menu titled "Menu" with two options: "Resume" and "Exit."

  - **Requirement 5.1.1.1:** Selecting "Resume" must close the menu and resume gameplay from the paused state.

  - **Requirement 5.1.1.2:** Selecting "Exit" must display a confirmation dialog asking, "Are you sure you want to leave the game?" with "Yes" and "Cancel" options.

    - **Requirement 5.1.1.2.1:** Choosing "Yes" in the confirmation dialog must exit the game.

    - **Requirement 5.1.1.2.2:** Choosing "Cancel" in the confirmation dialog must return the player to the game menu without resuming gameplay.

## 6. Asset Management

- **Requirement 6.1:** All game assets, including images and sounds, must be preloaded before the game starts to ensure smooth gameplay.

- **Requirement 6.2:** Assets must be optimized for performance to minimize load times and enhance the player's experience.

- **Requirement 6.3:** An asset management system should be implemented to efficiently load, organize, and access game assets.

## 7. User Interface

- **Requirement 7.1:** The game's user interface must be intuitive and provide clear instructions or feedback to the player.

- **Requirement 7.2:** The vertical ellipsis button and game menu options must be clearly visible and distinguishable from other game elements to prevent confusion.

- **Requirement 7.3:** The user interface should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.

## 8. Performance

- **Requirement 8.1:** The game must maintain a consistent frame rate to ensure smooth animations and responsive controls.

- **Requirement 8.2:** Memory usage must be managed effectively to prevent leaks and ensure the game runs efficiently on various devices.

- **Requirement 8.3:** Techniques such as object pooling and lazy loading should be employed to optimize performance.

## 9. Compatibility

- **Requirement 9.1:** The game must function correctly within the Android Emulator provided by Android Studio.

- **Requirement 9.2:** The game must be responsive and playable on different screen sizes of Android devices.

- **Requirement 9.3:** The game should be tested on multiple devices to ensure compatibility and performance.

## 10. Documentation

- **Requirement 10.1:** The project must include comprehensive documentation detailing the setup process, development environment, and instructions for running the game.

- **Requirement 10.2:** Code comments must be provided to explain complex or critical sections of the codebase to aid future development and maintenance.

- **Requirement 10.3:** A changelog should be maintained to document updates and modifications to the project.

## 11. Productivity Tools

- **Requirement 11.1:** The development environment may include additional tools to enhance productivity. While not mandatory, the following are recommended:

  - **ESLint:** To maintain code quality and consistency.

  - **Prettier:** For code formatting.

  - **Postman:** For API testing.

  - **Jest:** For unit testing JavaScript code.

  - **Phaser Inspector:** A browser extension for debugging Phaser games.

- **Requirement 11.2:** Visual Studio Code Extensions:

  - **ESLint Extension:** Integrates ESLint into VS Code.

  - **Debugger for Chrome:** Allows debugging JavaScript code in the Chrome browser.

  - **Prettier - Code formatter:** Integrates Prettier into VS Code.

  - **JavaScript (ES6) code snippets:** Provides code snippets for JavaScript development.

  - **GitLens:** Enhances Git capabilities within VS Code.
